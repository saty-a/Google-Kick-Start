Problem
-------
Let us call an integer interesting if the product of its digits is divisible by the sum of its digits. You are given two integers A and B. Find the number of interesting integers between A and B (both inclusive).

Input
-----
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T lines follow.

Each line represents a test case and contains two integers: A and B.

Output
------
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the number of interesting integers between A and B (inclusive).

Limits
